## ENV file

In the projectâ€™s root directory, you may find a .env.sample file. Rename the file to .env and add the following details:

```bash 
BASE_URL= "enter the project URL"
USERNAME= "enter the username"
PASSWORD= "enter the password"
PROD_NAME= "enter the Product name, such as '45W GaN Charger'"

## Run the Test

By default, Playwright runs tests in headless mode (without a browser UI). To run tests in headed mode (with a browser UI), use the --headed flag:
```bash
